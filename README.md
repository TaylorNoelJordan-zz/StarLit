This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# StarLit

StarLit is an app designed for the indecisive partier that seeks astrological guidance before a night out (_"Ask the stars if you should get lit!"_) A user begins by inputting their name and zodiac sign. Then, they receive a brief message specific to the current date as well as a verdict as to whether or not they should go out that night. This project is a demonstration of React and Redux principles as well as the implementation of API consumption. This particular app features an Emotion Text artificial intelligence that analyzes the daily horoscope and returns the type of mood each message conveys.
